        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        <br />
        <p>Long time no talk!</p>
        <p>
          Bria Reborn has been dormant for quite some time. If you stopped by at
          any point in the last few years, you may have been greeted by a
          cryptic page or even a new forum. We were working on a comeback a few
          years back, but sadly, we just didn't have the time to put in the
          effort that the community deserved. At the very least, we have
          reclaimed our domain name from domain squatters. We decided to keep
          this page up as a memorial to our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that you remember Bria Reborn with fondness. Many of us made
          friends and forged bonds that still last today. Bria Reborn was
          founded by people who had a burning passion for Star Wars Galaxies.
          And sure, sometimes that passion brought drama, but we persevered and
          made it work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Star Wars Galaxies, SWGEmu, Bria and Bria Reborn will always have a
          special place in our hearts. We wish you all the best in whatever or
          wherever life brings you next.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>May the force be with you... always, <br />Bria Reborn</p>
